i-HMS Sysconf component
======================

Introduction
------------
Sysconf is a configuration system for i-HMS modules. Sysconf provides a consistent approach for configuring modules and
gives the user a choice of interfaces. It can configure modules before they are installed, allowing installations and
major upgrades to request all necessary information in advance, and let you do what you want while modules are installed.
Sysconf lets you, if hurry, to skip the less important questions when installing modules.

Installation
------------

Sysconf still in prototype state. Install procedure will come soon.
