# Upon based on the Debian Debconf configuration file

# This is the main config file for Sysconf. It tells Sysconf where to store
# data. The format of this file is a set of stanzas. Each stanza except the
#Â first sets up a database for sysconf to use.
#
# So first things first. This first stanza gives the names of two databases.
# Sysconf will use this database to store the data you enter into
# it, and some other dynamic data.
Config: configdb
# Sysconf will use this database to store static template data.

# Sysconf will use the value of this field to filter debug messages that must
