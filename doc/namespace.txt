Questions and templates both exist in a hierarchical namespace. It can be arbitrarily deep, and is separated by '/'
characters, like a unix directory hierarchy. Here are the conventions we're using so far to divide up the namespace.

module/*		- This is the property of a single module, and can be subdivided however that module wants to.

shared/foo/*	- This holds items that are shared between several modules. "foo" is replaced by a name that relates to
				all of them. For example, news grabbers and readers all can use shared/news/server to store the news
				server they use.
